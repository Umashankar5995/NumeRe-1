Fixed	The suppression of some "print" statements near the end of a procedure and after some plotting command has been resolved.
Fixed	The y intervals of curve sets are now again calculated correctly.
Fixed	Tables and clusters will be deleted correctly, if one faces an error in a procedure argument list.
Fixed	The procedure extraction feature now considers references as output paths.
Fixed	Tables, which are not passed via a reference to an inline procedure, will throw an error.
Added	The concatenate functions hcat and vcat for matrices. Including documentation.
Fixed	A critical bug in the matrix operations mode was resolved.
Fixed	The function "getkeyval()" now also can handle numeric constants correctly.
Fixed	It's now possible to use "max(c{})" as range within "addyaxis" and "addxaxis".
Fixed	The rare case, where all data sets are assigned to the right axis and the left axis was calculated erroneously, was resolved.
Removed	The automatic focusing of UI elements is now disabled.
Added	"declares" are now includable in scripts, procedures and window layouts.
Fixed	"repeat()" now returns an empty string, if the repeat count is less than 1.
Cleaned	The secondary axes have now a little standoff to separate them from the graph. They will automatically force a bounding box.
Added	GUI layouts now feature a "combobox" as a new UI element.
Added	"logtoidx()" and "idxtolog()" are now usable on vectors without the "matop" mode.
Applied	Vector expansions are much faster now
Applied	General speed-up due to parallelisation and reduce of additional overhead.
Cleaned	Added performance improving implementations of multiplication and division operators for the "value_type" parser class (use of real-value based operations, where complex-valued operations are not necessary).
Cleaned	The "enablefuture" setting was replaced with a more explicit "alwaysreferencetables" setting, which is now also available in the options window.
Added	"datagrid" accepts now samples for both directions if passed as "samples={X,Y}"
Fixed	Table methods with the ".grid" modifier consider now the actual grid dimensions for their starting and ending indices.
New	The string function "getversioninfo()" returns version information about NumeRe as a key-value list.
Fixed	Strings containing quotation marks may now be returned correctly.
Fixed	The progress bar is not longer jumpy for small numbers.
Fixed	Density data plots in combination with the "bars" option will now correctly display all data grid values.
Cleaned	Added the table method modifier ".rows" and the number of rows variable "nrow" due to language correctness.
Applied	If local variables are highlighted, then they are highlighted everywhere in the procedure.
Applied	Autocompletion now features "SmartSense", which will provide much better autocompletion predictions.
Added	Variables, clusters and tables also have an icon in the autocompletion list now.
New	Editor tabs are now draggable, reorderable and can be split into various ways. By dragging a tab to a window screen, a hint will be displayed to indicate a possible splitting location.
Added	The editor tabs may now also show the file icons for better orientation
Applied	The tabs of the file tree, the history viewer and the documentation browser have also been updated and can now also be splitted.
Cleaned	The history is not longer getting saved, if no commands were entered into the terminal.
Added	Editor tabs may now be force-closed even if marked as modified, if the user presses the SHIFT key while clicking on the close button.
Fixed	Resolved a multiprocessing data race, which could result in a crash.
Added	The static code analyzer may now also detect misleading type prefixes.
Cleaned	The found search term in the editor is now always visible even if previously hidden or folded away.
Applied	"taylor" will now additionally return the calculated polynomial coefficients.
Added	Added the functions "is_dir()" and "is_file()" that check if a string is a valid directory or file name.
Fixed	"shuffle()" now also uses the common global random number generator.
Fixed	The function "valtostr()" may now handle strings for their first argument correctly.
Applied	The matrix functions "eigenvals()", "eigenvects()", "det()", and "diagonalize()" will now throw an error, if they face a matrix containing invalid values.
Fixed	"getkeyval()" was improved to handle more numerical cases.
Fixed	An interal error during string value comparison containing escaped quotation marks ("\"") was resolved.
Cleaned	Flow control headers are now also debuggable and interruptable. The contained expressions may however look a little bit weird.
Fixed	Long strings are now shortened before they are displayed within the GUI.
Fixed	String literals missing a quotation mark will now get one appended by the history automatically to avoid the string "leakage" effect over the following lines.
Cleaned	String functions are now much faster for larger strings.
Added	A context menu functionality was added to the editor to automatically detect and resolve variable type prefixes.
New	The command "include" will replace the old "@" syntax for inclusion of external files in the near future. NumeRe will display a warning for all old-fashioned "@" to simplify the replacing process.
