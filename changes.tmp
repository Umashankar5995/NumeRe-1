Fixed	Solved an issue with strange symbols in the console, which appeared in some cases while typing.
Fixed	"execute" may now handle string variables.
Fixed	"execute" tolerates now also "--" as parameter separator and throws an error with a better description, if tried with only one "-".
Fixed	Fixed a crash in seldom cases, if a file was read using "read", which contained function-like string elements.
Added	A "xor()" function was added.
Fixed	The missing "and" and "or" multiargument function options were added.
Fixed	Unfinished control flow blocks in procedures will bow raise an error during execution (instead of being ignored somehow).
Added	The static code analyzer may now find unfinished control flow blocks.
Fixed	The backslash may now be escaped in strings using a following whitespace.
Added	Now index vectors may be used to select the data in boxplots.
Fixed	NumeRe doesn't crash anymore, if one enters 'getfolderlist("*")' or 'getfilelist("*")'.
Fixed	The unhandled exceptions together with the static analyzer have been solved.
Fixed	The string parser now works as expected.
