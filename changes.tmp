Removed	Deprecated functions have been removed.
Fixed	Resolved a crash, which occured, if one pressed a non-navigation key (i.e. a usual character or a function key) if the keyboard focus was in the dependency tree, the revision tree, the variable list tree or the variable list tree in the debugger (library issue).
