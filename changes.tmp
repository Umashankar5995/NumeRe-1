Fixed	The smearing of the weightedlinear filter was removed and the filter was converted into a convolution filter.
Cleaned	Smoothing orders will now be converted internally into a windowsize of 2 x order + 1 to ensure odd numbers.
Fixed	The wrong string operator precedence was fixed.
Fixed	HOME and END will now close the autocompletion list and jump to their corresponding positions. This feature can be actived in the options.
Fixed	The matop function "diag()" will now accept matrices as input.
Cleaned	Refactored the matop function evaluation algorithm.
Cleaned	Commented the internal fitting algorithm.
Added	Created function"log_b(b,x)" to calculate a logarithm of x with the respect to the arbitrary base b.
Added	Created six matop functions for coordinate conversions: carttocyl(), carttopol(), cyltocart(), cyltopol(), poltocart() and poltocyl()
Added	Created two matop functions for coordinate to grid conversions and bilinearly interpolation.
Added	Created two string functions for searching all occurences (strfndall()) or the first occurences of all chars (strmatchall()).
Added	The autocompletion feature now provides block autocompletion.
New	Created a package repository browser with downloading, installing and deinstalling features.
Added	Created the table method "aliasof()", which references another table, whose name was passed to the method.
Applied	The currently selected stack trace element is now highlighted in bold font.
Fixed	"Save as" will now correctly select "*.nlyt" for layouts  and "*.nscr" for scripts.
Added	It is now possible to specify a file mask in the "filedialog" dialog type.
Added	The package creator may now store and load "NumeRe package projects" (*.npkp), which contain all relevant information for recreating the package.
Added	Documentation files (*.nhlp) have now specific icons, will be loaded into the file tree, have syntax highlighting and may be referenced in the package creator
Fixed	An uncatched exception, which occured after modifiying "\param" documentation keywords in combination with the static code analyzer, was removed.
Fixed	The terminal namespace and procedure autocompletion feature works now as intended.
Fixed	The documentation index should not display keywords multiple times anymore.
Fixed	The editor now can also resolve subnamespaces of "this".
Fixed	Resolved a rare issue occuring in combination with the "matop" mode and vector expressions in for loops.
Added	The "select(MAT,MAT,MAT)"  function allows using the two latter matrices (vectors) as indices for the first matrix.
Applied	It is now possible to link GUI plugins into the new "Packages" menu.
