Fixed	Fixed a bug in "copy" and "move", where caches like "fftdata()" were recognized as "data()" without raising an error.
Fixed	Disabled obsolete "nan's" at the end of shorter columns, if they are accessed in an expression.
New	A wavelet transformation is now available with the command "fwt" (fast wavelet transform). It's output defaults to "fwtdata()", which may be changed with the "target" option.
Applied	The fft now always defaults to "fftdata()" as target cache. This might be changed using the "target" option.
