Fixed	The scrolling of the terminal now works as intended.
Added	Two new styles were added to highlight documentation strings and their corresponding keywords.
Fixed	The auto indentation feature won't trigger any more, if a user presses navigation keys, delete, tab or backspace.
Applied	The static code analyzer is now timer-based and will wait 750msec after the latest modification before it evaluates the code. Calculation-heavy updates during typing are avoided using this approach.
Applied	The modifier ".every()" now accepts also a vector as first argument, which enables selecting single columns or lines directly.
