New	NumeRe now support complex numbers. Complex numbers may be entered using a number followed by the letter "i" or by using the function "complex()"
Added	Functions for complex numbers were added: "real()", "imag()", "to_rect()", "to_polar()", "conj()" and "complex()"
Cleaned	Underscores in table heads are now visible in the table viewer and all table printing functionalities.
Added	The string justify function to align strings in a vector of strings according to the mode chosen.
New	Tables can now contain complex values
New	Tables can now contain strings in distinct columns
Applied	Enhanced displaying speed of tables in the table viewer
Applied	NDAT file tooltips now display the NDAT file version instead of the NumeRe file version
Applied	Code snippets in the documentation browser are now highlighted with an additional grey background
Applied	The table editor has full flexibilty regarding string and value columns. If the values change, the column will try to convert itself to a more fitting type
Applied	String columns or tables containing strings in arbitrary locations can now be pasted into the table editor
Cleaned	"String-only" tables (i.e. tables with string columns) use the frist line always as column headings
Added	The feature to select only applicable commands from the command history based on the characters already entered by the user
Applied	The fft algorithm makes now use of the new built-in complex numbers.
Fixed	The fft algorithm will now adapt the number of input data points to match an even number, if larger than 1000 data points. This should enhance the speed of FFTs with data point counts of prime numbers.
