Fixed	Fixed a bug in "copy" and "move", where caches like "fftdata()" were recognized as "data()" without raising an error.
Fixed	Disabled obsolete "nan's" at the end of shorter columns, if they are accessed in an expression.
New	A wavelet transformation is now available with the command "fwt" (fast wavelet transform). It's output defaults to "fwtdata()", which may be changed with the "target" option.
Applied	The fft now always defaults to "fftdata()" as target cache. This might be changed using the "target" option.
Added	The Flag "mask" was added to the procedures, which will suppress system messages during this procedure and each called procedure
Fixed	An issue while sorting with many NaNs was fixed: now the NaNs are moved to the end correctly.
Fixed	"stats" may now work on tables with empty columns.
New	NumeRe may now call an external program using "execute". However, this command is disabled by default. If you need it, enable it in the settings dialogue.
Applied	If using "execute" one can now append the option "wait", which will force NumeRe to wait for the termination of the external application.
New	You can now link to an TeX distribution on your computer and use it to run LaTeX files or to create LaTeX documentations of your procedures or scripts.
Fixed	The random crashes if using the "med()" function on data with many NaNs are now fixed.
Fixed	The option "nologscale" can now be used in a set of subplots.
Fixed	The secondary axis is now created although a y range is set for the primary axis.
Fixed	"export" now works correctly again.
Fixed	Column headlines may now be compared directly (in comparison to using a additional string variable).
New	The function "findcolumn()" can be used to find all columns in a table, whose headlines are matching to the second argument in "findcolumn()".
New	If you type into the parentheses of functions, procedures or methods a tooltip will be displayed showing the corresponding function template and indicating the current argument.
Applied	You can now use an arbitrary number of "hlines" and "vlines" on your plot. PLEASE NOTE: the options "hline" and "vline" are now considered as deprecated. Use "hlines" and "vlines" instead.
Cleaned	The user interface of "sort" was cleaned so that it corresponds to the way the other commands are used.
Added	The command "sort" may now make use of mulitple, hierarchical used index columns and additionally it may return an index vector with the sorted order instead of sorting the data object explicitly.
New	Time formatting functions were added: "to_time()" transforms an time string into a time value and "timeformat()" transforms a time value into a time string using a defined pattern.
Updated	The file tree functionalities were enhanced: the file tree now supports drag'n'drop between folders as well as the creation and deletion of folders
New	Caches may now be used as arguments of procedures, if the argument list of the procedure requires a cache.
Fixed	Local caches can now be used as commands just like usual caches.
Added	The "<h>...</h>" tags can now be used in the documentation and will be rendered as headlines.
