Removed	Deprecated functions have been removed.
Fixed	Resolved a crash, which occured, if one pressed a non-navigation key (i.e. a usual character or a function key) if the keyboard focus was in the dependency tree, the revision tree, the variable list tree or the variable list tree in the debugger (library issue).
Cleaned	The ESC key will now only abort the current calculation, if the terminal has the keyboard focus.
