Fixed	The smearing of the weightedlinear filter was removed and the filter was converted into a convolution filter.
Cleaned	Smoothing orders will now be converted internally into a windowsize of 2 x order + 1 to ensure odd numbers.
Fixed	The wrong string operator precedence was fixed.
Fixed	HOME and END will now close the autocompletion list and jump to their corresponding positions. This feature can be actived in the options.
Fixed	The matop function "diag()" will now accept matrices as input.
Cleaned	Refactored the matop function evaluation algorithm.
Cleaned	Commented the internal fitting algorithm.
Added	Created function"log_b(b,x)" to calculate a logarithm of x with the respect to the arbitrary base b.
Added	Created six matop functions for coordinate conversions: carttocyl(), carttopol(), cyltocart(), cyltopol(), poltocart() and poltocyl()
Added	Created two matop functions for coordinate to grid conversions and bilinearly interpolation.
Added	Created two string functions for searching all occurences (strfndall()) or the first occurences of all chars (strmatchall()).
Added	The autocompletion feature now provides block autocompletion.
