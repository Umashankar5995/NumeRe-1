New	The new command "warn" can be used to warn users using the warning colour of the editor.
Fixed	Re-enabled the menu help strings in the main window's toolbar.
Added	The rename symbols dialog now features a changes log for the current file, which will display the tasks done by this dialog. It won't be updated using the undo and redo commands.
Fixed	Vector plots like the one in the "vect3d" description are now work as expected.
Fixed	Complex plot compositions are now possible and work as expected.
Updated	The function definition logic now provides the "lclfunc" command, which declares functions locally, and the "undef" command may now remove multiple functions at once.
Added	LaTeX commands now have an autocompletion list as well.
New	The variables "nlines" and "ncols" may now be used as table "end" constants for the corresponding direction.
Cleaned	Tables may now store and handle "inf" and "-inf" correctly.
Cleaned	The internal architecture of the definition object was improved.
Applied	The debugger was massively improved and supports now standard features like "Step", "Step over" and "Step out". Additionally it supports modifiying breakpoint during execution and now halts the execution right before an error is processed.
Added	The transparency factor and the number of contour lines may now be modified by appending the value to the corresponding option value (i.e. "alpha=0.75" and "pcont=7")
New	The "dialog" command may be used to display various dialogs to interact with the user.
New	A new data type is available: a so-called "cluster", which can contain strings and numerical values in an arbitrary order. It is always single-dimensioned and constructed on-the-fly like usual variables and unlike tables.
Applied	The procedure and flow control algorithms now support "true inlining", which means that the contents of a inlined procedure is actually copied to the calling flow control statement.
Removed	The undo buffer of the editor is not cleared anymore after the file was saved. This allows undo actions to revert changes done before the last save point.
Fixed	Small fixes for interactions with C++ and MATLAB files
Added	Enabled the multi-selection pasting and the rectangular pasting, which was disabled by the wxSTC-Interface to Scintilla.
Added	One may now activate that NumeRe folds all code during loading files.
Added	The new string functions for clusters were added: "is_table()" and "is_cluster()". Additionally, the function "locate()" can be used to find a specific string in a whole string array.
Added	The static code analyzer will no warn about global variables, which are used in procedures. A setting is available to deactivate this behavior.
Added	A table viewer for clusters and the string()-table was created. It is accessible using commands, the variable viewer and the debugger (for "string()" only if global variables are listed in the debugger).
Cleaned	The internal indexing algorithms were changed. Therefore, similiar accesses using index vectors are now possible more or less everywhere.
Fixed	Resolved an issue with the "to_value()" conversion function.
Fixed	Resolved an issue with the "textparse()" function
Added	Bookmarks may now be saved upon application shutdown and will be restored in the next session.

New	A package creator is now available from the "Tools" menu to create packages from your procedures.
Added	Arrays of curves may now be plotted, if the columns of the current tables are selected using an index vector.
Applied	Double hitting "HOME" or "END" on your keyboard will move the cursor in the terminal at very beginning or end of the current input line even if it spans multiple lines in the terminal.
Cleaned	Cleaned the behavior of LEFT and RIGHT (will now move between lines) in the terminal and added CTRL-LEFT and CTRL-RIGHT to jump between words.
Fixed	A strange heap corruption issue going from the terminal seems to be corrected now.
New	Added two new matop functions: "correl()" (correlation) and "covar()" (covariance)
New	The file and symbol trees and the documentation index feature now a search bar, which allows the user to search in its contents for objects.
Updated	The math style in the documentation articles was update to resemble a more TeX-like layout.
Fixed	The crash upon removing the last item in the package creator was resolved.
