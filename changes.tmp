Added	The context menu of the file tree now offers the possibility to copy the file or folder paths to the clipboard.
Added	It is now possible to copy text with its styling information to insert it into MS-Word or MS-PowerPoint.
Fixed	Dragging a file in the file tree won't accidentally delete the file any more, if it enters the same directory as before.
Added	The character sequences "NA" and "N/A" are now also considered as NaN in text file-based data sets.
Added	Added the filter function that allows filtering a matrix with any filter kernel.
Added	Tables may now contain "logical" columns, which are restricted to boolean values.
Added	Tables may now contain "category" columns, which enumerate string values to make them usable in numerical calcutions.
Added	The table method "TAB().categorylist()" returns the enumerated categories of the selected categorial columns as a key-value list.
Cleaned	Date-time columns are no longer completely overwritten by real-only values (which allows for time modifications).
Fixed	The function "replaceall()" can now also replace null characters.
Added	The table method "TAB().categorize()" can be used to rename the during conversion automatically detected categories.
Fixed	Rendering times of large tables in the table viewer have been greatly reduced.
Fixed	The hang after a very long string was evaluated has been resolved.
Cleaned	Copy, cutting and pasting text in the teminal does now work with the usual CTRL-C, CTRL-V and CTRL-X command key sequences.
Updated	The rendering of values in tables has been generally improved.
New	The string function "sha256()" can be used to calculate the SHA-256 of strings and files.
Added	The new v4 NDAT und CACHE files have now a SHA-256 checksum to detect possible file corruption.
New	The table method modifiers "TAB().rows" and "TAB().cols" can now be used solely and return the number of table rows or columns, respectively.
Cleaned	The valtostring parser operator "#" behaves now a bit different compared to the "valtostr()" function: logical, categorical and datetime table columns will return their values formatted as strings ("true"/"false", the category name or the formatted time value).
