Added	The context menu of the file tree now offers the possibility to copy the file or folder paths to the clipboard.
Added	It is now possible to copy text with its styling information to insert it into MS-Word or MS-PowerPoint.
Fixed	Dragging a file in the file tree won't accidentally delete the file any more, if it enters the same directory as before.
Added	The character sequences "NA" and "N/A" are now also considered as NaN in text file-based data sets.
Added	Tables may now contain "logical" columns, which are restricted to boolean values.
Added	Tables may now contain "category" columns, which enumerate string values to make them usable in numerical calcutions.
Added	The table method "TAB().categorylist()" returns the enumerated categories of the selected categorial columns as a key-value list.
Cleaned	Date-time columns are no longer completely overwritten by real-only values (which allows for time modifications).
Fixed	The function "replaceall()" can now also replace null characters.
Added	The table method "TAB().categorize()" can be used to rename the during conversion automatically detected categories.
