Fixed	The scrolling of the terminal now works as intended.
Added	Two new styles were added to highlight documentation strings and their corresponding keywords.
Fixed	The auto indentation feature won't trigger any more, if a user presses navigation keys, delete, tab or backspace.
Applied	The static code analyzer is now timer-based and will wait 750msec after the latest modification before it evaluates the code. Calculation-heavy updates during typing are avoided using this approach.
Applied	The modifier ".every()" now accepts also a vector as first argument, which enables selecting single columns or lines directly.
New	The commands "load", "append" and "imread" will now return indices of the loaded data in the target tables.
Applied	Changed the style of the static code analyzer messages and the color of the warnings to enhance readability and visibility.
Fixed	The static code analyzer will now calculate the results, if it is activated at file open time.
Applied	Smoothing was changed slightly and allows now to use different filter types.
New	NumeRe now allows only a single running instance. Double clicking files will open them in the already opened instance. Instance located in different root folders (e.g. "C:/Software/NumeRe" and "C:/Software/NumeRePortable") are not restricted, i.e. only one instance per root folder is allowed.
Cleaned	The symbols' tree updates the function definitions and plugin definitions each time, one of them is changed, automatically.
Removed	The obsolete Datafile class was removed and its functionality is now integrated in the MemoryManager class.
Cleaned	The "data()" table is now a usual table with regular write permissions.
Updated	The default table is now called "table()". This will get active once the memory is cleared. You may however rename "cache()" to "table()" as well using "rename cache(), table()".
Added	The method "TABLE().name" will return the name of the table as string. This is an abbreviation for "to_string(TABLE())", which could be used together with "findcolumn()".
Cleaned	The command sequence "clear TABLE()" will now only clear the contents of the selected TABLE().
Cleaned	The command sequence "clear -memory" will remove all tables from memory and also clear the contents of the string table.
Cleaned	The command "reload" will in the future be used like "load FILE". The old syntax is now deprecated and the new is already available.
Added	The method "TABLE().size" will return the tables size in rows and columns.
Added	The methods "TABLE().minpos" and "TABLE().maxpos" will return the positions of the minmal or maximal values in the table using rows and columns.
Added	The matrix function "repmat()" will repeat the passed table (n x m) times and return it as a new table.
Cleaned	During loading are now filenames now stored and will be used for "reload". The filenames are accessible via "data(#,#)".
Added	Added the multi-argument functions "minpos()" and "maxpos()" as usual function representations for their corresponding methods.
Cleaned	Resolved an glitch in "export", where the default extension was "ndat" and not "dat".
Cleaned	Added the LaTeX "nonstopmode" to all LaTeX usages.
Updated	Reworked all database-related stuff, which is used internally for the "find" command, the hints, and some other stuff.
Cleaned	Changed the base control for the search bars to be more responsive.
Added	Created a "Tell me, what you want to do" searchbar in the toolbar.
