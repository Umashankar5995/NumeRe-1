Fixed	Solved an issue with strange symbols in the console, which appeared in some cases while typing.
Fixed	"execute" may now handle string variables.
Fixed	"execute" tolerates now also "--" as parameter separator and throws an error with a better description, if tried with only one "-".
Fixed	Fixed a crash in seldom cases, if a file was read using "read", which contained function-like string elements.
Added	A "xor()" function was added.
Fixed	The missing "and" and "or" multiargument function options were added.
Fixed	Unfinished control flow blocks in procedures will bow raise an error during execution (instead of being ignored somehow).
Added	The static code analyzer may now find unfinished control flow blocks.
Fixed	The backslash may now be escaped in strings using a following whitespace.
Added	Now index vectors may be used to select the data in boxplots.
Fixed	NumeRe doesn't crash anymore, if one enters 'getfolderlist("*")' or 'getfilelist("*")'.
Fixed	The unhandled exceptions together with the static analyzer have been solved.
Fixed	The string parser now works as expected.
New	The table viewer and the table editor are calculating simple statistics on-the-fly.
Fixed	NumeRe may now read and write source code files by escaping control sequences specific for NumeRe.
New	NumeRe has now lexers for MATLAB and C/C++ source code files.
Added	NumeRe has now a duplicate code analysis for MATLAB and C/C++ source codes.
Added	NumeRe has now an autoformatter for MATLAB and C/C++ source codes.
Added	The results of the duplicate code analysis may now be copied from the result table and saved to a file.
Added	The font style (bold, italics, underlined) of the syntax elements in the editor may now be changed in the settings dialogue.
Applied	The duplicate code analysis is significantly faster now.
Fixed	Solved a critical issue when using the "cnt()" function together with data sets-
Fixed	The NumeRe editor may now write large files (lines > 20000).
Added	The matop functions "logtoidx()" and "idxtolog()" were added.
Cleaned	In matop mode, if the target cache is passed with empty argument parentheses, it is cleared now before the result is stored (the content is overwritten completely).
Added	The results of the duplicate code analysis may now be sorted according to a desired column by clicking on the corresponding headline.
