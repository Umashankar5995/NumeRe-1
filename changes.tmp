Fixed	The suppression of some "print" statements near the end of a procedure and after some plotting command has been resolved.
Fixed	The y intervals of curve sets are now again calculated correctly.
Fixed	Tables and clusters will be deleted correctly, if one faces an error in a procedure argument list.
Fixed	The procedure extraction feature now considers references as output paths.
Fixed	Tables, which are not passed via a reference to an inline procedure, will throw an error.
Added	The concatenate functions hcat and vcat for matrices. Including documentation.
Fixed	A critical bug in the matrix operations mode was resolved.
Fixed	The function "getkeyval()" now also can handle numeric constants correctly.
Fixed	It's now possible to use "max(c{})" as range within "addyaxis" and "addxaxis".
Fixed	The rare case, where all data sets are assigned to the right axis and the left axis was calculated erroneously, was resolved.
Removed	The automatic focusing of UI elements is now disabled.
Added	"declares" are now includable in scripts, procedures and window layouts.
Fixed	"repeat()" now returns an empty string, if the repeat count is less than 1.
Cleaned	The secondary axes have now a little standoff to separate them from the graph. They will automatically force a bounding box.
Added	GUI layouts now feature a "combobox" as a new UI element.
Added	"logtoidx()" and "idxtolog()" are now usable on vectors without the "matop" mode.
Applied	Vector expansions are much faster now
Applied	General speed-up due to parallelisation and reduce of additional overhead.
Cleaned	Added performance improving implementations of multiplication and division operators for the "value_type" parser class (use of real-value based operations, where complex-valued operations are not necessary).
Cleaned	The "enablefuture" setting was replaced with a more explicit "alwaysreferencetables" setting, which is now also available in the options window.
Added	"datagrid" accepts now samples for both directions if passed as "samples={X,Y}"
Fixed	Table methods with the ".grid" modifier consider now the actual grid dimensions for their starting and ending indices.
New	The string function "getversioninfo()" returns version information about NumeRe as a key-value list.
Fixed	Strings containing quotation marks may now be returned correctly.
