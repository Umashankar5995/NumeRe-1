Added	Added the filter function that allows filtering a matrix with any filter kernel.
Added	Tables may now contain "logical" columns, which are restricted to boolean values.
Added	Tables may now contain "category" columns, which enumerate string values to make them usable in numerical calcutions.
Added	The table method "TAB().categoriesof()" returns the enumerated categories of the selected categorial columns as a key-value list.
Cleaned	Date-time columns are no longer completely overwritten by real-only values (which allows for time modifications).
Fixed	The function "replaceall()" can now also replace null characters.
Added	The table method "TAB().categorize()" can be used to rename the during conversion automatically detected categories.
Fixed	Rendering times of large tables in the table viewer have been greatly reduced.
Fixed	The hang after a very long string was evaluated has been resolved.
Cleaned	Copy, cutting and pasting text in the teminal does now work with the usual CTRL-C, CTRL-V and CTRL-X command key sequences.
Updated	The rendering of values in tables has been generally improved.
New	The string function "sha256()" can be used to calculate the SHA-256 of strings and files.
Added	The new v4 NDAT und CACHE files have now a SHA-256 checksum to detect possible file corruption.
New	The table method modifiers "TAB().rows" and "TAB().cols" can now be used solely and return the number of table rows or columns, respectively.
Cleaned	The valtostring parser operator "#" behaves now a bit different compared to the "valtostr()" function: logical, categorical and datetime table columns will return their values formatted as strings ("true"/"false", the category name or the formatted time value).
Fixed	Excel files containing only strings are now readable correctly.
Fixed	Excel files containing line breaks in cells are now readable correctly.
Fixed	Setting icons for layouts is now possible.
Added	Created new table methods: "TAB().fndcols()" (searches columns for headlines), "TAB().indexof()" (creates indices for columns for selected values) and "TAB().countif()" (counts occurences of values).
Applied	Table and string methods are now also part of the symbols tree and can be dragged into the editor or the terminal.
Added	NumeRe now supports Zygo MetroPro(r) *.dat files as well.
Added	"hist" may now use time axes in its plot.
Cleaned	The error message for bad alloc was rephrased to reflect the actual issue.
Applied	"to_time()" and "timeformat()" will now use automatic pattern (detection), if the pattern is an empty string.
Cleaned	It is now possible to drag code with comments to the terminal. The code will be executed normally.
Fixed	Resolved a small bug in "legendre_a()" hindering from using it in the hydrogen orbital wave functions.
Cleaned	The cloudplot uses now more samples than before and will take a bit longer to render. However, the result is visually more appealing.
Cleaned	The restore functionality of the revisions dialog now chooses the current file for overwriting automatically. The restore creates also a new revision to undo the restore.
New	A menu option was added to compare two files and display the comparison result as a unified diff.
New	It is now possible to apply conditional cell background colours to tables opened with the table viewer.
Fixed	If single cells are selected in the table viewer, their statistics are now calculated correctly.
Added	A whole bunch of new table methods were added: "pcorrof()", "scorrof()", "covarof()", "*rankof()", "zscoreof()", "anovaof()"
Added	External files now feature the complete version control timeline now. The corresponding "*.revisions" file is stored in the same folder.
Cleaned	Already installed packages with the same or a newer version won't now be overwritten by a package install or its dependencies.
Added	If a package is created and it is also already installed, the package creator will now ask, whether the installed version shall be synchronized with the created one (e.g. will update the version number).
Fixed	Handling of the "is_CHARTYPE" functions for empty strings is now defined as return FALSE.
Applied	The tooltips of procedures in the file tree will now contain the documentation and signature of the main procedure in this file.
New	The functions "weekday()" and "weeknum()" can be used to obtain the number of the weekday and the number of the (ISO) calendar week.
Fixed	The wrong order of opening and closing character sequences for block comments for "read" was resolved.
Added	"read" may now also consider string delimiters to actually ignore comments character sequences within strings.
Added	The table viewer has now many more functionalities accessible via the new menu bar. It can save the table directly, convert column types and refresh the displayed contents from the kernel.
Applied	Constant value function folding has been added to the numeric parser improving the calculation speed by 10-20% (depending on the amount of used constant values).
Fixed	A not necessary recursion in the "matop" command has been removed and a memory read bottleneck was resolved improving the calculation speed of large matrices to a factor of 4.
New	It is now possible to store the window splitters' positions as well as the window size and position and restore that after a restart. Both options can be enabled in the settings.
Applied	The plot option "axis" does now accept an additional value to indicate, whether the dependent plot axes shall be selected nice or equal.
New	Added a range-based for loop with a new syntax: "for (iter -> RANGEOBJECT)"
Added	The range-based for loop may now accept combined iterators like "for ({key,val} -> keyvallist{})"
Fixed	Swapping aliased tables will now correctly update all aliases. This is also valid for aliased tables used as return value.
Cleaned	Calling "is_string()" on a vectorized expression will now return the type for every component instead for the whole expression.
Cleaned	Enabled the loading and listing of "DIFF" files in the editor.
Applied	Enabled vector plots from complex functions and complex-valued data grids.
Cleaned	Resolved a glitch, where empty lines in a documentation block could create persistent section marks, which would only be removed after disabling the sectioning feature and re-enabling it again.
Fixed	It is now possible to use already declared local variables as values for the following variable definitions in the same line.
Fixed	NLYT files are now draggable in the and from the file tree.
Cleaned	Resolved the glitch that if the mouse cursor enters the tooltip, the tooltip was hidden. Now it is persistent and hides itself once the mouse clicks on another text or window element.
Added	Installing a local package can now also be done using the entry in the "Packages" menu.
Updated	Greatly improved the "Package Repository Browser", which is now called "Package Manager" as it better describes its purpose.
Added	It's now possible to select the font of the history and the terminal as well.
Added	The table method "binsof()" may be used to calculate a simple histogram of a selected column.
