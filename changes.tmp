Fixed	Solved an issue with strange symbols in the console, which appeared in some cases while typing.
Fixed	"execute" may now handle string variables.
Fixed	"execute" tolerates now also "--" as parameter separator and throws an error with a better description, if tried with only one "-".
Fixed	Fixed a crash in seldom cases, if a file was read using "read", which contained function-like string elements.
Added	A "xor()" function was added.
Fixed	The missing "and" and "or" multiargument function options were added.
Fixed	Unfinished control flow blocks in procedures will bow raise an error during execution (instead of being ignored somehow).
Added	The static code analyzer may now find unfinished control flow blocks.
Fixed	The backslash may now be escaped in strings using a following whitespace.
Added	Now index vectors may be used to select the data in boxplots.
Fixed	NumeRe doesn't crash anymore, if one enters 'getfolderlist("*")' or 'getfilelist("*")'.
Fixed	The unhandled exceptions together with the static analyzer have been solved.
Fixed	The string parser now works as expected.
New	The table viewer and the table editor are calculating simple statistics on-the-fly.
Fixed	NumeRe may now read and write source code files by escaping control sequences specific for NumeRe.
New	NumeRe has now lexers for MATLAB and C/C++ source code files.
Added	NumeRe has now a duplicate code analysis for MATLAB and C/C++ source codes.
Added	NumeRe has now an autoformatter for MATLAB and C/C++ source codes.
Added	The results of the duplicate code analysis may now be copied from the result table and saved to a file.
Added	The font style (bold, italics, underlined) of the syntax elements in the editor may now be changed in the settings dialogue.
Applied	The duplicate code analysis is significantly faster now.
Fixed	Solved a critical issue when using the "cnt()" function together with data sets-
Fixed	The NumeRe editor may now write large files (lines > 20000).
Added	The matop functions "logtoidx()" and "idxtolog()" were added.
Cleaned	In matop mode, if the target cache is passed with empty argument parentheses, it is cleared now before the result is stored (the content is overwritten completely).
Added	The results of the duplicate code analysis may now be sorted according to a desired column by clicking on the corresponding headline.
Fixed	The console now always scrolls down before something is printed in the console.
Added	NumeRe may now use the "##!" and "#*!" comment sequences as section beginnings, if one activates this option from the "view" menu.
Added	Right-clicking on an item in the duplicate code dialogue will now jump the active line to the red code range.
Fixed	Scalar results may now be stored at multiple locations in the target cache.
New	NumeRe may now load images as datagrids into memory using the "imread" command.
Fixed	Added the binary logical operators to the complexity algorithm.
Fixed	"progress" now evaluates the strings passed through "type=TYPE" correctly.
Fixed	Loops do not abort automatically any more, if one uses a $ in a string inside a loop.
Fixed	String variables may now be used as sources for legends in plots.
Added	New functions are available: "psi(x)", "psi_n(n,x)", "beta(x,y)", "zeta(x)", "Li2(x)", "Cl2(x)"
New	Multi-argument functions on data sets may now be invoked using methods, e.g. "data().avg.lines.grid.every(3,5)"
Fixed	In procedures, one may now use comment sequences in strings. These are not interpreted as comments any more.
Fixed	Column headlines do not disappear any more after deletion.
Fixed	"interpolate" does not mask "steps" any more.
Fixed	The editor does not override, if it cannot write the current file, files with empty files any more. Instead a backup is created, which will be restored automatically. The user is now notified, if a file cannot be written.
Fixed	The "floor()"  function may now be used correctly on data sets. The token reader for multi-argument functions was improved significantly.
Fixed	Writing to files with non-standard file extensions is now possible.
