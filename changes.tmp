New	The commands "load", "append" and "imread" will now return indices of the loaded data in the target tables.

Fixed	The static code analyzer will now calculate the results, if it is activated at file open time.

New	NumeRe now allows only a single running instance. Double clicking files will open them in the already opened instance. Instance located in different root folders (e.g. "C:/Software/NumeRe" and "C:/Software/NumeRePortable") are not restricted, i.e. only one instance per root folder is allowed.
