Applied	Changed the memory management of the caches. NumeRe may now handle more memory tables, if they are different in size (which is usual the case)
Fixed	The "cnt()" now returns reasonable values if applies on empty cache regions.
Applied	The resampler now supports stream-like resampling and is therefore now able to handle larger data sets.
Fixed	Vectors may now be used as indices in "matop" mode.
Added	Plot labels may now also be suppressed by using an empty label.
Fixed	In "matop" mode, mathematical functions and "is_nan()" are now working correctly again.
Fixed	The crash while plotting with "bars" and "boxplot" together is now fixed.
Fixed	The command "load" may now be used again together with "string()" and a parameter.
Fixed	Index vectors may now be used to extract table headlines again.
Fixed	NumeRe doesn't flicker any more in Win10 1803.
Fixed	The sectioning functionality is now working correctly for textfiles.
Added	One may now select the minimal code block length for the duplicate code analysis.
Fixed	'datagrid' may now handle asymmetric data sets.
Fixed	Multiple fixes in the bytecode handling in the parser. Obscure errors, which may occur inside of loops are now hopefully avoided. In addition, the loop mode was sped up if the loop does only contain numerical calculations.
