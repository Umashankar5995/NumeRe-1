Applied	Changed the memory management of the caches. NumeRe may now handle more memory tables, if they are different in size (which is usual the case)
Fixed	The "cnt()" now returns reasonable values if applies on empty cache regions.
Applied	The resampler now supports stream-like resampling and is therefore now able to handle larger data sets.
Fixed	Vectors may now be used as indices in "matop" mode.
Added	Plot labels may now also be suppressed by using an empty label.
Fixed	In "matop" mode, mathematical functions and "is_nan()" are now working correctly again.
Fixed	The crash while plotting with "bars" and "boxplot" together is now fixed.
Fixed	The command "load" may now be used again together with "string()" and a parameter.
Fixed	Index vectors may now be used to extract table headlines again.
Fixed	NumeRe doesn't flicker any more in Win10 1803.
Fixed	The sectioning functionality is now working correctly for textfiles.
Added	One may now select the minimal code block length for the duplicate code analysis.
Fixed	'datagrid' may now handle asymmetric data sets.
Fixed	Multiple fixes in the bytecode handling in the parser. Obscure errors, which may occur inside of loops are now hopefully avoided. In addition, the loop mode was sped up if the loop does only contain numerical calculations.
Added	Code metrics vor MATLAB files are now available.
Added	NumeRe's static code analyzer may now detect magic numbers.
Cleaned	"resample" and "smooth" have now much more helpful error messages
Fixed	The highlighting of MATLAB files now works as expected.
Applied	The handling of the tables for the table viewer is now done via pointers. This should speed-up the process a bit.
Cleaned	The terminal of NumeRe was significantly improved and allows now to wrap around long lines correctly.
Fixed	The issue in the resampler code was fixed. This also required to change the behaviour of all other memory functions.
Fixed	Removed a segmentation fault, which occured during the storage of strings into the 'string()' object.
Fixed	Solved an issue, where the usage of braces in strings as returns values of procedures yielded strange errors.
Fixed	The 'to_string()' function may now handle strings containing masked strings correctly.
Added	Bar charts may now show reasonable legends by separating the legends of multiple bar charts using the linebreak character.
Fixed	Table headlines may now be used as regular string vectors and are now composable using "sum()".
Fixed	Matrices may now be multiplied with vectors componentwise.
Fixed	Strings as return values for procedures may now be used in expressions again.
Fixed	Dollar signs may now be used in string literals, which are part of the argument list of procedures.
Fixed	The last line of the history is now always visible at start-up.
Fixed	Data element expressions may now be used directly within string expressions.
Fixed	The data ranges of boxplots are now calculated correctly.
New	NumeRe may now rename a selected symbol and all its occurences in the current file while considering the scope of the symbol.
New	NumeRe may now extract a selected region of code into a new procedure.
Added	The editor font and size may now be changed by the user.
Fixed	Closing NumeRe may now aborted, if a file was not saved yet.
New	NumeRe now features a "Busy-Indicator" in the status bar, which pulses, if NumeRe is currently working.
New	The "matop" mode now features are "unique()" function, which will remove duplicates from a passed matrix.
New	The new string function "textparse()" allows parsing a line of text using a pattern into a set of tokens of defined types.
Added	Documentation strings in or above NumeRe procedures are now displayed as tooltip.
Applied	Documentation strings in NumeRe procedures are now copied during an installation to be usable as tooltip documentation.
Cleaned	Semicolons are now used consistently in loops and if statements. Use them to suppress the output on the console.
Added	New setting in the GUI to enable the flow control "-mask" flag as default. Added the "-sp" flag to force the process display although the "-mask" flag is enabled.
Fixed	"hist" may now display more than two columns.
Fixed	Backslashes are now masked correctly in strings.
