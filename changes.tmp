Fixed	The smearing of the weightedlinear filter was removed and the filter was converted into a convolution filter.
Cleaned	Smoothing orders will now be converted internally into a windowsize of 2 x order + 1 to ensure odd numbers.
Fixed	The wrong string operator precedence was fixed.
Fixed	HOME and END will now close the autocompletion list and jump to their corresponding positions. This feature can be actived in the options.
Fixed	The matop function "diag()" will now accept matrices as input.
Cleaned	Refactored the matop function evaluation algorithm.
Cleaned	Commented the internal fitting algorithm.
Added	Created function"log_b(b,x)" to calculate a logarithm of x with the respect to the arbitrary base b.
Added	Created six matop functions for coordinate conversions: carttocyl(), carttopol(), cyltocart(), cyltopol(), poltocart() and poltocyl()
Added	Created two matop functions for coordinate to grid conversions and bilinearly interpolation.
Added	Created two string functions for searching all occurences (strfndall()) or the first occurences of all chars (strmatchall()).
Added	The autocompletion feature now provides block autocompletion.
New	Created a package repository browser with downloading, installing and deinstalling features.
Added	Created the table method "aliasof()", which references another table, whose name was passed to the method.
Applied	The currently selected stack trace element is now highlighted in bold font.
Fixed	"Save as" will now correctly select "*.nlyt" for layouts  and "*.nscr" for scripts.
Added	It is now possible to specify a file mask in the "filedialog" dialog type.
Added	The package creator may now store and load "NumeRe package projects" (*.npkp), which contain all relevant information for recreating the package.
Added	Documentation files (*.nhlp) have now specific icons, will be loaded into the file tree, have syntax highlighting and may be referenced in the package creator
Fixed	An uncatched exception, which occured after modifiying "\param" documentation keywords in combination with the static code analyzer, was removed.
Fixed	The terminal namespace and procedure autocompletion feature works now as intended.
Fixed	The documentation index should not display keywords multiple times anymore.
Fixed	The editor now can also resolve subnamespaces of "this".
Fixed	Resolved a rare issue occuring in combination with the "matop" mode and vector expressions in for loops.
Added	The "select(MAT,MAT,MAT)"  function allows using the two latter matrices (vectors) as indices for the first matrix.
Applied	It is now possible to link GUI plugins into the new "Packages" menu.
Added	The command "audioread" can read the metadata of or a whole audio file.
Added	The command "seek" can extract sections of audio files.
Applied	The internal command line parsing structure was farly unified. Command line parsing issues should now be trackable and resolvable more easily.
Fixed	Resolved a runtime issue when sorting large, already sorted data sets.
New	The command "url" can be used to access online resources and to even upload files to a remote FTP server.
Fixed	The Package Repository Browser can now safely be closed during a transmission operation. Closing might take some seconds until the current operation terminates or times out.
Added	The Package Repository Browser has now a search functionality.
Fixed	The refresh-boundary issue of 2D integrals was resolved.
Fixed	Goto procedure definition now may also find relative namespaces referenced by "this" namespace.
Removed	The documentation index file was removed. The documentation index is now created at startup from the list of available documentation files. Documentation articles have been reworked and need now keywords, an idxkey and a contents block.
Fixed	If a procedure has unmatched parentheses, it won't throw that it is unreadable anymore but rather the actual issue.
Fixed	Introduced 64 bit time types. This required a NDAT file type update to version 2.1, which will contain the 64 bit types in the first of their placeholder fields.
Applied	The "fft" command will now produce a two-sided spectrum, which will contain every frequency twice (negative and positive).
Added	Using the parameter "axisshift" on "fft" will align the resulting spectrum around the y axis or rearrange the transformed spectrum for inverse transformation.
Added	Using the command "declare" one may declare file-specific constants valid for the current procedure or script file.
Added	Packages may now contain whole files using the "<file>...<endfile>" block
