Fixed	Solved an issue with strange symbols in the console, which appeared in some cases while typing.
Fixed	"execute" may now handle string variables.
Fixed	"execute" tolerates now also "--" as parameter separator and throws an error with a better description, if tried with only one "-".
Fixed	Fixed a crash in seldom cases, if a file was read using "read", which contained function-like string elements.
Added	A "xor()" function was added.
Fixed	The missing "and" and "or" multiargument function options were added.
Fixed	Unfinished control flow blocks in procedures will bow raise an error during execution (instead of being ignored somehow).
